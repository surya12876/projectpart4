        <h1>Scombroid</h1>

    <div>
        <p>Scombroid food poisoning, also known as simply scombroid, is a foodborne illness that typically results from eating spoiled fish.The syndrome is named after the fish family Scombridae, which includes mackerels, tunas, and bonitos, because early descriptions of the illness noted an association with those species, although nonscombroid fish such as mahi-mahi and amberjack may also cause the condition.
        </p>
    <h3>Causes</h3>    
    <p>Scombroid occurs from eating fish high in histamine due to inappropriate storage or processing.Fish commonly implicated include tuna, mackerel, mahi mahi, sardine, anchovy, herring, bluefish, amberjack, and marlin. These fish naturally have high levels of histidine, which is converted to histamine when bacterial growth occurs during improper storage</p>

    <h3>Symptoms</h3>

        <li> facial flushing/sweating </li>

   <li class="k"> Isolated reports of scombroid food poisoning in humans caused by histamine present in the tissues of stale or rotten scombroid fish, usually tuna, have occurred over the years. In September 2016, authorities in Singapore intercepted canned tuna imported from Thailand after finding high levels of histamine.[9] No human cases were reported. In 2015, seven people at a cafe in Sydney became ill after eating John Bull Tuna Chunky Style in safflower oil on tuna salads.[10] The tinned tuna had come from Thailand. The Shenzhen Post reported that histamine poisoning from scombroid fish happens often in the autumn in Guangdong province in China.[11] In August 2013, 26 people in Shenzen were poisoned after eating stale mackerel. Several people became ill after eating tuna sandwiches at a cafe in Edinburgh in Scotland in 2013.[12] The tuna had come from Ghana. In 2011, 20 reports of food poisoning at a Stockholm restaurant were thought to be histamine poisoning in tuna from Senegal. In 2012, UK environmental health authorities in north east Lincolnshire intercepted and destroyed a shipment of tuna from Vietnam after four crew members were reported to have developed symptoms of histamine poisoning. Commercially canned tuna was determined to be the cause of the poisoning of 232 persons in the north-central United States in 1973 </li>
